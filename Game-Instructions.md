Introduction:

The rules for Connect Four are pretty simple. Try to connect four of your pieces in a row before your opponent even gets a chance. But don't forget, you can connect your four pieces in many ways: vertically, horizontally, and even diagonally.

What you've got:

- A grid, where you place the pieces
- 21 red pieces
- 21 yellow pieces

Game Play:

1. First decide who plays first. If you're having trouble, just do something like rock-paper-scissor to decide.
2. Player One gets the RED pieces.
3. Player Two gets the YELLOW pieces.
3. Player One starts the game of by dropping one of his/her RED pieces down ANY slot at the top of the grid.
4. Player Two continues the game by dropping one of his/her YELLOW pieces down ANY slot at the top of the grid.
5. Continue alternating until a player gets FOUR pieces in a row. The four pieces in a row can be vertical, horizontal, or even diagonal.
6. However, if neither players are able to get four pieces in a row, just restart the game from scratch.
7. Congrats you just learned how to play Connect Four!
